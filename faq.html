                        </h4>
                            <p>While Twister OS will install on the 3B+ it is not recomended. Twister OS was designed and built around the Pi4 and you may experience issues installing on the 3B+.</p>

                            <a href="#">Is Twister OS a 64-bit OS?</a>
                        </h4>
                            <p>Twister OS is currently a 32-bit OS, but it will become 64-bit when the 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS comes out of beta. For now, you can go to CommanderPi > "Bootloader" and click "Switch kernel architecture" at the bottom to use a experimental 64-bit kernel. This has the potential to brick your system, so it isn't for the faint of heart who arn't willing to make backups.</p>

                                <p>playonlinux was removed due to too many complaints that not a lot was working with it. You can reinstall with sudo apt install playonlinux && sudo apt remove wine You need to remove wine because playonlinux will install the arm version which will conflict with x86 version of wine.</p>
