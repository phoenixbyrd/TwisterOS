                            <h3>Is there an update tool so I don't have to manually update?</h3>

                              <h3>Why can't my pi read the data off a external device??</h3>
                                <p>Your drive could be formatted with fat32 or another file system that Linux cannot read. You can backup the data on the device, and reformat it with System -> GParted to another file system like exfat.</p>

                            <h3>Where is Play on Linux?</h3>
                                <p>playonlinux was removed due to too many complaints that not a lot was working with it. You can reinstall with sudo apt install playonlinux && sudo apt remove wine You need to remove wine because playonlinux will install the arm version which will conflict with x86 version of wine.</p>

                                <p>For example, if extracted to home directory you would run this in terminal</p>
                                <span class="code">~/wine/bin/wine path/to/your/game.exe</span>

                            <h3>Some icons on my panel/taskbar are missing!</h3>

                            <h3>Why does retropie ask me to log in?</h3>
                                <p>You must have disabled auto-login
                                If that's the case, you'll just need to hit "enter" when taken to the console prompt. It'll tell you "invalid login" or something to that effect
                                Then, when prompted, enter "pi" as the username, and "raspberry" as the password (or whatever you've changed the pi account password to)
                                Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the desktop, and then you'll be able to launch RetroPie by just double-clicking on the icon</p>
