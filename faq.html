                            <h3>What is the password?</h3>
                                <p>The default password is raspberry</p>
                                <p>Please change your password by opening terminal and entering <span class="code">passwd</span></p> 
                                <p>Please also change your root password. <span class="code">sudo -i</span> and then run <span class="code">passwd</span></p>

                            <h3>Will This Run On My Pi 3B+</h3>
                                <p>While Twister OS will install on the 3B+ it is not recomended. Twister OS was designed and built around the Pi4 and you may experience issues installing on the 3B+.</p>

				<p>If you are attempting to use Twister OS on a Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+, and are taken directly to the terminal at boot, type sudo nano /boot/config.txt, and modify the last two sections of the file to exactly match the following (note the use of "#" symbols):</p>

				<ol style="list-style: none; line-height: 2em;">
				<li>[pi4]</li>
				<li># Enable DRM VC4 V3D driver on top of the dispmanx display stack</li>
				<li>#dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d</li>
				<li>#max_framebuffers=2</li><br>

				<li>[all]</li>
				<li>dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d</li>
				<li>gpu_mem=128</li><br>
				</ol>

				<p>Once finished, save the file (Ctrl + O), and then exit nano (Ctrl + X). Then type sudo reboot at the terminal prompt and press Enter. Once your Raspberry Pi 3B/3B+ reboots, Twister OS should start normally.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Is Twister OS a 64-bit OS?</h3>
                                <p>Twister OS is a 32-bit OS.</p>

                            <h3>How do I patch Twister OS?</h3>
                                <ol style="list-style: none; line-height: 2em;">
                                    <li>Ideally from version 1.5.2 and up you would use the Twister OS Patcher application included. If you prefer to manually patch, follow these directions.</li>
                                    <li>NOTE: If Twister OS Patcher fails, or you feel may not have updated your system properly please report the occurance on Discord. You can reinitiate Twister OS Patcher by editing /usr/local/bin/twistver to read the version previous from the one you are attempting to patch up to.</li>
                                    <li>Download the patch you need</li>
                                    <li>Now open terminal and navigate to downloads folder <span class="code">cd ~/Downloads</span></li>
                                    <li>Once you are in ~/Downloads enter <span class="code">chmod +x *Patch.run</span></li>
                                    <li>Now start the Patch process with <span class="code">./*Patch.run</span> </li>
                                    <li>Quick trick, you can type the first character and hit the tab key to autocomplete the filename.</li>
                                    <li>When upgrading please patch in order. Patch 1.0 to 1.1 to 1.2 to 1.3 etc.</li>
                                </ol>

                            <h3>Is there an update tool so I don't have to manually update?</h3>
                                <p>As of version 1.6 Twister OS Patcher has been included, you can find it in System -> Settings.</p>

                            <h3>Youtube is laggy or has screentearing, is there a fix for that?</h3>
                                <p>You can try installing this updated XFWM4 package updating from 4.12 to 4.16. This seems to help with screen tearing in videos, but some issues might still remain.</p> <a href="https://twisteros.com/xfwm4_4.16.99-1_armhf.deb">Download Here</a>

                            <h3>Where is Play on Linux?</h3>
                                <p>playonlinux was removed due to too many complaints that not a lot was working with it. You can reinstall with <span class="code">sudo apt install playonlinux && sudo apt remove wine</span> You need to remove wine because playonlinux will install the arm version which will conflict with x86 version of wine.</p>
                            
                            <h3>Where can I download wine?</h3>
                                <p>Download Wine <a class="here" href="https://twisteros.com/wine.tgz">HERE</a></p>
                                <p>To use, extract wine.tgz and run the wine binary from wine/bin</p>
                                <p>For example, if extracted to home directory you would run this in terminal</p>
                                <span class="code">~/wine/bin/wine path/to/your/game.exe</span>

                            <h3>Why does retropie ask me to log in?</h3>
                                <p>You must have disabled auto-login
                                If that's the case, you'll just need to hit "enter" when taken to the console prompt. It'll tell you "invalid login" or something to that effect
                                Then, when prompted, enter "pi" as the username, and "raspberry" as the password (or whatever you've changed the pi account password to)
                                Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the desktop, and then you'll be able to launch RetroPie by just double-clicking on the icon</p>

                                <p><span class="code">sudo touch /etc/chromium-browser/customizations/01-disable-update-check;echo CHROMIUM_FLAGS=\"\$\{CHROMIUM_FLAGS\} --check-for-update-interval=31536000\" | sudo tee /etc/chromium-browser/customizations/01-disable-update-check
