                                    <li>Ideally from version 1.5.2 and up you would use the Twister OS Patcher application included. If you prefer to manually patch, follow these directions.</li>
                                    <li>NOTE: If Twister OS Patcher fails, or you feel may not have updated your system properly please report the occurance on Discord. You can reinitiate Twister OS Patcher by editing /usr/local/bin/twistver to read the version previous from the one you are attempting to patch up to.</li>
                                    <li>Download the patch you need</li>
                                    <li>Now open terminal and navigate to downloads folder <span class="code">cd ~/Downloads</span></li>
                                    <li>Once you are in ~/Downloads enter <span class="code">chmod +x *Patch.run</span></li>
                                    <li>Now start the Patch process with <span class="code">./*Patch.run</span> </li>
                                    <li>Quick trick, you can type the first character and hit the tab key to autocomplete the filename.</li>
                                    <li>When upgrading please patch in order. Patch 1.0 to 1.1 to 1.2 to 1.3 etc.</li>
                                </ol>

                            <h3>Why does retropie ask me to log in?</h3>
                                <p>You must have disabled auto-login
                                If that's the case, you'll just need to hit "enter" when taken to the console prompt. It'll tell you "invalid login" or something to that effect
                                Then, when prompted, enter "pi" as the username, and "raspberry" as the password (or whatever you've changed the pi account password to)
                                Press Ctrl+Alt+F7 to return to the desktop, and then you'll be able to launch RetroPie by just double-clicking on the icon</p>
